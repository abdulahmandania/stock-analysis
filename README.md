# Stocks-Analysis
# Overview, Purpose and Background
  This project was completed to assist Steve in finding the best stocks his parents can invest in. The company Steve's parents were initially set on investing in is DAQO, which makes silicon wafers for solar panels. 
# Results
 Results indicate that DAQO may not be good to invest in at this time as the return rate was approximately -0.626. Due to the rate being negative, we analyzed return rates of some other stocks that may be good for Steve's parents to invest in. Results showed that ENPH and RUN are good stocks to invest in at this time as their return rates were significantly positive.

# Summary
  In summary, we were able to analyze the return rates of 12 stocks and compare them to each other using VBA, then refactoring the code to loop through all the data at once. Refactoring the code was effective and useful in this scenario.

   - Pros: Refactoring code can help save lots of time in the future when analyzing large amounts of data, executes data results faster, and helps make software easier to understand in the longrun.
   - Cons: Refactoring code could sometimes lead to new errors and bugs in the code if mistakes are made, even very small mistakes.
   ##### When working with this specific code, it took me a while to refactor because it was difficult to simplify the code while making sure it will still give the desired outcome. However, this was effective and the macro took less time to run refactored compared to the original code.
